# Ansible Project Template

## Overview
Often times the only thing that stands between you and a finished project is
the ability to deploy to production. This Ansible project template was built
for the use of deploying a [Django Project Template](https://github.com/jdeanwallace/django-project-template)
in mind, but it can be altered to deploy any web-app.

## Requirements
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) (0.7+)

## Usage
```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/jdeanwallace/ansible-project-template
```
